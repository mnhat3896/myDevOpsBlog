First, thank you for visiting my blog and read my article, I appreciate it. Secondly, this is also a place to keep my idea, my knowledge. At the same time, I also want to share these understandings, in a way it can help you or you can have another perspective on your problem.

Please read and see from many angles that it is suitable for your situation or not.
If you have any suggestion or you see my mistake in any posts, please help me by contacting me via Telegram, Email or LinkedIn. Thank you :heart:

The question is how we can monitor our machines that are having issues when we aren't looking??. Yes, That is "continuous monitoring".
But why is Prometheus have to run on Docker?. Why we don't use any other tools that can easily install via package management on the server-based?
First, Prometheus is a popular tooling, easy to config (it uses a YAML file to tell the service what metric you want to scrape), easy to read :wink:. Secondly, I don't want to install the whole package, dependency package,...etc on my machine so here I use Docker. The last is I familiar with Docker and Prometheus, so I want to practise it :blush:.

### NOTE

* Node-Exporter repository: https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter
* Prometheus repository: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus  
* Grafana repository: https://github.com/grafana/grafana

I assume that your server has already intalled Docker. If don't you can check this guild <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/>.
To implement continuous monitoring, we need service that can scrape those metrics on the target machine, right? This server also has to send metrics that It scraped to a a place to store. Then we can use a tool that has UI and human-readable to configure and read the metric.
So the plan is

* Run a scraper, here is I use Node-Exporter
* Set up Prometheus server
* Read metric via UI tool, here I use Grafana

## Node-Exporter

docker run -d --name node_exporter -p 9100:9100 prom/node-exporter

## Prometheus Step

1.Configuration file

* Create `.yaml` file in your working directory, example at `/your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
* Add this setting to yaml file:

  Take a look at "targets" attribute in yaml file, there are 2 IP of the node in AKS. (Change these IPs for suitable with your scenario)

  ``` yaml
  # my global config
  global:
    scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
    evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
    # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

  # Alertmanager configuration
  alerting:
    alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
      - targets:
        # - alertmanager:9093

  # Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global 'evaluation_interval'.
  rule_files:
    # - "first_rules.yml"
    # - "second_rules.yml"

  # A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
  # Here it's Prometheus itself.
  scrape_configs:
    # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
    - job_name: 'node-export'
      metrics_path: '/metrics'
      static_configs:
      - targets: ['10.250.1.4:9100','10.250.1.5:9100']
  ```

2.Add user 'prometheus'
   `sudo useradd prometheus --system --no-create-home`
3.Give permission with the file's path you create above. To let container can read this configuration file
   `sudo chown prometheus /your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`
4.If you want to mount data Prometheus to outside, If don't skip this step (*)

* Create folder to save prometheus's data, ex: `mkdir -p /your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/data`
* Give permission for user 'nobody': `sudo chown nobody /your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/data`
* Reference Dockerfile Prometheus here, if you wonder why use I 'nobody' : https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/Dockerfile

5.Run Prometheus server (only server, not include scraping service)
  If you haven't created a network, run: `docker network create XXX`. (_Remember to let container prometheus and grafana in the same network_)  

  (*) Remove line `-v /your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/data:/prometheus/data` if you don't want to mount data to outside
  
  ``` command
    docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --user nobody --network bravo --name prometheus_server \
    -v /your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    -v /your-directory/monitoring/prometheus/data:/prometheus/data prom/prometheus:v2.26.0 \
    --config.file="/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml" --storage.tsdb.path="/prometheus/data"
  ```

## Grafana Step

  ``` command
  docker run --name grafana -p 3000:3000 --network bravo -d grafana/grafana:7.5.2-ubuntu
  ```

**_Secondly, install node-export in AKS_**

1. ## Add repo bitnami with helm
   `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
2. ## Install service scraping on AKS (node-exporter)
   _**chart node-exporter will scrape metrics related to the nodes then expose an endpoint to let Prometheus get that metrics**_  

   `helm install node-exporter bitnami/node-exporter -n monitoring --version 2.2.4`  

   Check if the chart is on: `kubectl get all -n monitoring`

_**Finally, add Grafana to nginx.conf ( If you haven't install Nginx, take a look at the Logging page )**_  
- Add this block to nginx.conf : `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`  

  _change server_name to a new hostname as you want_

  ```
       server {
           server_name grafana-systemtest.bravosuite.io;
           listen 443 ssl http2;
           ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/cert.pem;
           ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/cert.pem;
           location / {
              proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           }
        }
  ```
- Restart Nginx: `nginx -s reload` or `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
- Go to Cloudflare and add `grafana-systemtest.bravosuite.io` to DNS management. (_information Cloudflare, ask leader_)

## Add Prometheus database to Grafana
- Then go to Grafana hostname you have set up above, and follow this article to add Prometheus to Grafana: https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/
- After that, you need to write a query or install an existing dashboard written by someone else
  - You can search a dashboard, for example, I searched a dashboard that shows all information about the nodes as we install "node-exporter" above: 
    https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards?search=node
  - Reference how to import a dashboard: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/  

That's all. If you change anything else. Please go here and update it
