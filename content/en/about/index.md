Hi, I'm Nhat Le. I used to a Frontend Developer. But one year ago. I decided to change my career path to become a DevOps Engineer. To be honest, I do not know about this job at that time.  
At that point, I want to do something for my own ( This may be the same for most people :laughing: ). So I think, I will develop an application "dating app" with a guy who was my teammate. I in charge of Backend. So from there, I spent my time to do reach about `server, Linux (bash script), python, docker,.. etc`. I was like entering a new world, a world of unrestricted curiosity and research. I realized that I enjoyed what I learned, what I could automate. And for a long time the position that got me interested, able to research new things, experiment with many things, was DevOps Engineer. I don't visualize or promote this title, I just don't like something over and over again, I like the novelty, study new things and apply them, practice them.
