<h4> Hi, I'm Nhat Le </h4>
This is my personal blog, I do this website just want to make this website like a note to save and sharing all my ideas, problems, knowledge during my DevOps career path. Hope somehow it can be helpful for you.

I used to a Frontend Developer for 2 years. But one year ago. I decided to change my career path to become a DevOps Engineer. To be honest, I do not know about this job at that time.

------

Here is a short story about why i was change my career path :books:
At that point, I want to do something for my own ( This may be the same for most people :laughing: ). So I think, I will develop an application "dating app" with a guy who was my teammate. I in charge of Backend. So from there, I spent my time to do reach about `server, Linux (bash script), network, python, docker,.. etc`. 
I was like entering a new world, a world of unrestricted curiosity and research :rocket: . I realized that I enjoyed what I learned, what I could automate. And for a long time the position that got me interested, able to research new things, experiment with many things, was DevOps Engineer. I don't visualize or promote this title, I just don't like something over and over again, I like the novelty, study new things and apply them, practice them.

Three months later from the day i know about this job, I decided to resign as a developer to switch to new paths. Yes, just a few months and I don't have any real experiment. I know if I switch, I have to face the salary, learn from scratch, many things behind that. To imagine that if i have family, i have to raise my children and more??.  Hahaha i know, that's sound crazy :joy: . But luckily for me, I met a man.
He and I work in the same company. The reason why i met him is through an introduction from the HR department. He helped me to find a good way to go. The second luckily is I was transferred to another team which working on a product for company. Then I have been practising on Azure cloud, Kubernetes, CI|CD, have all the times to learn and practice more :kissing:

Honestly, you have to wish and do what you want. The power of your desire and effort will make that happen. 
Please do not just wish, you have to learn and practise. I have to learn every day even though the weekend. The people they work 8 hours a day, I work 10 - 12 hours a day. When ever I get free time, I learn :blush:

Ancient people have a sentence: “nhân định thắng thiên” mean human determination will overcome destiny
